The script uses two main libraries to work with PDF files: Camelot for finding tables and PyMuPDF (fitz) for extracting text. These libraries use different ways to describe where things are located on a page. Camelot measures positions from the bottom-left corner of the PDF page, while PyMuPDF measures from the top-left corner. Because of this difference, we need to adjust how we understand the positions of tables on the page.
To ensure we accurately separate text from tables, we convert Camelot's coordinates (which start from the bottom-left) to match PyMuPDF's system (which starts from the top-left). This conversion involves adjusting the Y-coordinates of table bounding boxes to fit the page's height in PyMuPDF. Once these coordinates are aligned, we can effectively determine if each block of text overlaps with any table.
For text-table separation, the script uses a method to check if each text block is inside any of the adjusted table bounding boxes. If a text block overlaps with a table's area, it's filtered out and not included in the final extracted text. This ensures that only text outside of any detected tables is retained and presented to the user.
By implementing this approach, the script ensures that the extracted information from PDFs is accurate and usable. It prevents mixing up text that belongs to tables with other textual content, thereby improving the reliability and clarity of the extracted data for further analysis or display. This methodical approach enhances the overall effectiveness of handling PDF documents programmatically.



Explanation:

    Extract Full Text:
        Extract the full text from the specified page using PyMuPDF.

    Extract Table Text:
        For each table cell, convert Camelot coordinates to PyMuPDF coordinates.
        Extract the text within these coordinates to get the table text.

    Extract Remaining Text:
        Redact the table areas to remove table text from the full text.
        Extract the remaining text after redaction.

    Gradio Interface:
        Display the extracted table text and the remaining text in two separate columns using two gr.Textbox components.
